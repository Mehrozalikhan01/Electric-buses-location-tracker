\textbf{Description:}

The Context Diagram shows the Electric Bus Location Tracker System as a central entity with its external interfaces:

\textbf{External Entities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Passengers}: Receive real-time bus information, routes, schedules, and EAT
    \item \textbf{Drivers}: Send GPS location data, view duties; receive duty assignments and view all previous skipped and completed duties
    \item \textbf{Administrators}: Monitor system, manage routes/schedules/buses, receive reports
    \item \textbf{GPS Satellites}: Provide positioning data for accurate tracking
    \item \textbf{Google Maps API}: Provides mapping services, route calculations, and EAT data
    \item \textbf{PMA (Punjab Mass Transit Authority)}: Registers administrators and gives access to data from their database
\end{itemize}
